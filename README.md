This repository implements the Variational Recurrent Neural Network (VRNN) in pure `PyTorch` using `PyTorch Lightning`. There is a demo training in the toy MNIST dataset.

Feel free to open issues and discussions for improving the implementation.

# Requirements

* The repository was created with `Python 3.11` but newer versions compatible with the other libraries should also work.
* `PyTorch 2.9.1`
* `pytorch-lightning 2.5.6`
* `torchmetrics 1.8.2`
* `torchvision 0.24.1`
